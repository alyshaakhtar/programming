What kind of work-life balance are you looking for? Where do you want to work, geographically? You don't have to write this down here, just think about it.\n",

        "  *I was surprised that the outlook for data science over the next decade is 36% because even though I knew data science is a rapidly growing field, I did not know it was growing that much. It was also interesting to see how the median annual salaries vary for different roles, but many of them were close to $100k which is promising. I was also surprised about the lack of growth for project management specialists because I know many people are interesting in pursuing jobs in this area, but there is still a very large number of jobs.*\n",

Rank the jobs you picked from best to worst, and briefly explain why you did so. *From best to worst, I would rank the jobs as Management Analyst, Project Management Specialist, Data Scientist, Financial Analyst, Operations Research Analyst, Market Research Analyst, Computer and information Research Scientist, and Mathematician/Statistician. This is because I am very interesting in pursuing a job in consulting or project management, so the first 2 roles stood out. Data Scientist is clearly a great role with a high salary, especially considering only a Bachelor's degree is required. Then, I ranked some other roles requiring only a Bachelor's degree in descending salary order, and then finally the two degrees requiring a Master's degree because I do not currently plan to pursue that.*\n",

Like we talked about, Python is a general purpose programming language and ships without basic data handling or statistical packages coded in. The beginning of the code chunk below generates random values for you to test your work on; since the random values are generates as NumPy arrays, you'll need to use the Numpy methods `np.sum(x)` to sum the vector $x$ and `np.sqrt(x)` to take the square roots of the values in $x$, as well as the Python function `len(x)` to get the length of $x$.\n",
